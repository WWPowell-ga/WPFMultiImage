## Roadmap - Beta

So much has changed since original Roadmap  
New Roadmap seems wise  

A. Wonder if .PCX could be added - read if not write perhaps  
[Used to work at ZSoft so it's one for my homies]  
B. International support [move all strings to a resource file - is that how it's done?]  
C. Save a 'scenario' [basically a list of loaded image files; dump the dictionary] - JSON?  
D. Reopen a 'scenario'  
E. Error hdling????? Probably doesn't need logging per se.  
F. Help system ... from user guide?  
G. About box. Gotta have one!  

# Notes from the worklog
H. Can I get the FileOpenDialog & SaveFileDialog in CenterScreen? Initial attempts failed  
I. Note System.Windows.Media.PixelFormats contains good info but is deep.  
I'll have to write a BIG switch to support it.
J. I have both a menu and a toolbar and no rhyme or reason as to where you go to do what.
This needs a rethink.
K. It loads images. It saves images. It displays some statistics.  
Seems like it should do one more thing really well.  
Multi-image GIF/TIF?  
JPEG compression?  
Palette smashing?  
Metadata editing? 
Palette sorting? Is that even useful?
