# Roadmap

1. Program will run child windows inside a main window
2. You should be able to load multiple image files 'at once'
3. .gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg support
4. Wonder if .PCX could be added - read if not write perhaps
[Used to work at ZSoft so it's one for my homies]
5. Image statistics [file size, create date, etc.]
6. More image statistics [most popular color, number of colors actually used]
7. International support [move all strings to a resource file - is that how it's done?]
8. Save a 'scenario' [all child window positions] - JSON?
9. Reopen a 'scenario'  
10. A statusbar is probably appropriate but what shall it say?  
11. Error hdling????? Probably doesn't need logging per se.
12. Help system ... from user guide?
13. About box. Gotta have one!
