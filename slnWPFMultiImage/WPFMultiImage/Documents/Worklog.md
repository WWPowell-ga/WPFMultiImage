## 2022 Jan 4 
Joined Twitter so I can Tweet at #IAmTimCorey.

## 2022 Jan 5 
Joined GitHub and did initial commit of project after rewatching Tim Corey video.

## 2022 Jan 6
Changed Twitter handle  
Tweeted Markdown cheetsheet  
Rebuilt Worklog  
Completed initial roadmap - this is subject to change  

## 2022 Jan 7
Moved menu to a UserControl - so when people wnat to upgrade this app by adding menu items they should leave MainWindow alone and upgrade usMainMenu [probably]  
  
I've done several similar 'image apps' before in WinForms. Current job is a WPF shop so this is an opportunity to learn.  
  
The code in ucMainMenu then should fire code in MainCode. ucMainMenu should have VERY little code.
File->EXIT works.

## 2022 Jan 8
Stubbed in File->Open so I could see the child window I built with a 'child' menu.  
Added WINDOWS to main menu  
Went to study what a WPF FileOpenDialog looks like - I've done WinForms and assume this will be similar  
Added ChildWindow, ucChildMenu, ChildCode  
Started coding Open File dialog  

## 2022 Jan 9
Open File Dialog working
Basic stats working
Image loading

TO DO:
- [ ] Open File dialog should CenterScreen
- [ ] Statistics grid spaces out rows way too far
- [ ] Scrollviewer and Imag don't yet co-operate fully

I've decided I don't like the 'child window approach'. If you open many images the screen gets too cluttered to work on.  
I'll keep it for now and explore some better alternatives later

## 2022 Jan 10
Scrollviewer and Img are more co-operative. Statistics grid has better spacing. SO many options in WPF.  
Statistics from bitmap as well as file  
Started breaking down the bitmap metadata  
Started minimizing, maximizing, normalizing, and closing all windows.    
Extent of child area of main window is wrong!  

## 2022 Jan 11
I'm starting to write Windows inside a window inside a window - messy.  
Also the MDI 'style' is shunned these days. Who knew. The hazards of being old...  
Going to start moving to a Navigation-style window I think.

## 2022 Jan 13
Created robust ImagesClass  
Started creating CarouselClass  

## 2022 Jan 14
Getting closer  
BitmapImage is not being returned??? Maybe should be BitmapSource???  

## 2022 Jan 15
Stupid bug with BitmapImage fixed  
ImageGrid displaying images  
Stats complete but not Palette  
Note System.Windows.Media.PixelFormats contains good info but is deep.  
I'll have to write a BIG switch to support it. Later. 
Toolbar added  
I can move to next/previous image  
I can show/hide stats  
I can close an image  

## 2022 Jan 16
Started save image and that works    
Cleaned up palette info  

## 2022 Jan 17
Final testing and alpha release  
Worked on RoadmapBeta  

## 2022 Jan 18
Built resource file to make lang. translation a little easier.
It's not a full BAML...

Tonight is Marshall Westbrook night.  

Marshall sent in a suggestion on the right sidebar resizing I'll try to fix.

*The stats and palette sidebar doesn't adjust according to the window size. This makes viewing the image difficult in a window that isn't maximized.*
*The workaround that I used is to hide the stats once I am not in a maximized screen.*
*Maybe the stats and palette sidebar could be ".2*" with a scroll viewer (or something along those lines)?*

He also did a pull request and built an about box. I'll take a quick look and see if I can figure out  
how to merge.

## 2022 Jan 21
Merge worked. Have decided to build my own about box after trying a couple of  
Nuget packages.

More code suggestions from Marshall Westbrook arrived but I need to finish what I have before  
tackling those.

About Box completed though it is plain.

#2022 Jan 22
Completed moving text strings to resource file.  
That's all I'll do for internationalization.  

The right sidebar is what it is. Every thing else I tried just looks wrong.  

I wonder if palette sorting is at all useful? Adding it to RoadmapBeta  

#2022 Jan 23
Marshall Westbrook emailed

*When saving images on my computer I noticed that the default name for files is the full containing folder's path (in addition to the original image's name).*
*Save File Dialog opens in the correct directory, but the file name it's attempting to save as is the full directory.*
*Current Behavior: Saving as file name "C:\Programming\WPFMultiImage\slnWPFMultiImage\WPFMultiImage\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\Capture.tif"*
*Expected Behavior: Saving as file name "Capture.tif"*

So I fixed it.
