#Roadmap

1. Program will run child windows inside a main window
2. You should be able to load multiple image files 'at once'
3. .gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg support
4. Wonder if .PCX could be added - read if not write perhaps
[Used to work at ZSoft so it's one for my homies]
5. Image statistics [file size, create date, etc.]
6. More image statistics [most popular color, number of colors actually used]
7. International support [move all strings to a resource file - is that how it's done?]
8. Save a 'scenario' [all child window positions] - JSON?
9. Reopen a 'scenario'
